## Implementations Options considered

Need Annotation schema specification

Check out recent annotation spec by W3C [https://www.w3.org/annotation/](https://www.w3.org/annotation/)

Combine, selection, annotation, tag, and event info/papercut for paper edit/“JSON EDL” when multiple annotations combined. With some as optional fields. Eg tags, etc..  


Could use [http://tether.io](http://tether.io) to keep annotation close to selection in trascription .And coul use bootstrap popovers [https://getbootstrap.com/javascript/\#popovers](https://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers)
