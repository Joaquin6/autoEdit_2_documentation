# Transcriber: STT API

it was important for the transcriber to have the flexibility of working with different solution for Speech To Text. 

Eg currently working with 

- IBM Watson STT, 
- Gentle Open Source STT
- Pocketsphinx 

However in the future, could integrate with other providers such as speechmatics, Google, Microsoft Bing etc..


## Refactoring 

use design patterns to clean this up, and make it easier to extend. eg Strategy or factory?
