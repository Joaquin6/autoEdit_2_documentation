# Support the project - draft
 
There is a number of ways you can support the project. 

## Keep up to date with latest releases

Sing up to the [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/cMzwSX), follow on [twitter](http://twitter.com/autoEdit2) and [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/autoEdit.io/) to keep up to date with [the latest releases](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/releases). 


## Help with translations
Help translate the user manual and app in different languages.


## Help out with documentation 

Especially if you are new to the project, and you read through the docs, and things don't make sense, feel free to get in touch via email <a href="mailto:pietro@autoEdit.io?Subject=Hello" target="_top">pietro@autoEdit.io</a> or [@pietropassarell](twitter.com/pietropassarell) or [raise an issue on github](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2) chances are that if it's not clear to you it's not clear to others, and I'd love to lower the barry of entry as much as possible. Also always looking for people to proofread.



## Give some feedback on use cases

If you have been using autoEdit, or parts of it, or are working on something similar, I am always super interested in hearing about thoughts and considerations in this problem domain.

## For Developers

#### Roadmap 
If you are a developer, check out the [roadmap](/roadmap.md) and see if there's anything that it's of interest you'd like to discuss or get involved with or have any insight into any of those areas. Always happy to have a chat. 

#### Reusable components
Also looking for help making some of the [reusable components](/reusable-components.md) more robust and accessible so that it's easier to get up to speed with projects in similar problem domain. 

On that note I am organising an event, [textAV.tech](http://textav.tech) as a way to kickstart an ongoing conversation/collaboration a round the use of captions and transcriptions for video production and one of the topics is making an ecosystem of reusable components. 

#### Testing
I need to setup a better test strategy for the project and would love some inputs and ideas on this. [See testing section](/testing.md). 


## Support the project

[autoEdit.io](www.autoEdit.io) it's free and open source. Free as in free speech as well as in free beer. [Help support the autoEdit project to keep it that way](https://donorbox.org/c9762eef-0e08-468e-90cb-2d00643697f8?recurring=true). 

Support will go towards fixing bugs, adding features, provide support for users etc...
