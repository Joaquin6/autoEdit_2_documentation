# Support the project

There is a number of ways you can support the project. 

## Keep up to date with latest releases

Sing up to the [mailing list](), follow on [twitter](http://twitter.com/autoEdit2) and [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/autoEdit.io/) to keep up to date with [the latest releases](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/releases). 


## Help with translations
Help translate the user manual and app in different languages.


## Help out with documentation 

Especially if you are new to the project, and you read through the docs, and things don't make sense, feel free to get in touch pietro@autoEdit.io 

<!-- TODO: How to link email in markdonw? -->

or [@pietropassarell](twitter.com/pietropassarell) or [raise an issue on github](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2) chances are that if it's not clear to you it's not clear to others, and I'd love to lower the barry of entry as much as possible. 


## Give some feedback on use cases

If you have been using autoEdit, or parts of it, or are working on something similar, I am always super interested in hearing about thoughts and considerations in this problem domain.

## Developers

#### Roadmap 
If you are a developer, check out the [roadmap](/roadmap.md) and see if there's anything that it's of interest you'd like to discuss or get involved with or have any insight into any of those areas. Always happy to have a chat. 

#### Reusable components
Also looking for help making some of the [reusable components](/reusable-components.md) more robust and accessible so that it's easier to get up to speed with projects in similar problem domain. 

On that note I am organising an event, [textAV.tech](http://textav.tech) as a way to kickstart an ongoing conversation/collaboration a round the use of captions and transcriptions for video production and one of the topics is making an ecosystem of reusable components. 

#### Testing
I need to setup a better test strategy for the project and would love some inputs and ideas on this.
