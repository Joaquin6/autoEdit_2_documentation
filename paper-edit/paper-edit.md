## Component/part description

### Paper-edit json schema specification
Connected to this is defining a schema for paper-edit, to make sure all components that work with this have a defined interface/specification.  This is same as a spec for “EDL JSON” which is used in the EDL composer module. 

<!-- link to appendix example -->

- [component:Search and filter ](/paper-edit/paper-edit/paper-editsearch-filter.md)
- [component:Drag and Drop papercut ](/paper-edit/paper-edit/paper-editdrag-and-drop.md)
- [component:Video preview ](/paper-edit/paper-edit/paper-editvideo-preview.md)

## What needs refactoring

The flow and consistency of json data representation between the different components json is not great, needs to be revisited.

For instance Paper-edit and transcription EDL export should have consistent schema. at the moment they are different.
