Initially speced out as a [REST API with sails](https://github.com/pietrop/autoEditSailsApi)

. Now backbone packaged in nwjs. But usefull to see [API specs to get a sense of the OOD ](https://github.com/pietrop/autoEditSailsApi/blob/master/notes/api_end_points_v2.md)

Still to be added properly in 1.0.6 is `annotations` and `tags`. There are selections but at the moment lacking key features of categorisation and searchability.

Also still to be implemented in v1.0.6 is the `projects` to group transcripts and paper-edits together.
