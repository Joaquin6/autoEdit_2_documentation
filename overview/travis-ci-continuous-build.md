# Travis CI continuous build

  
There is no deployment as such as it's electron app, so the build described above serves as a packaging of the app for release.  
  
However As of version `1.0.8` support is added for Linux thanks to [@probonopd](https://github.com/probonopd), [\#36](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/issues/36).  
On commit to master there is a continuos built setup on Travis CI that builds and adds an up to date linux release to the release section under [Continuous build](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/releases/tag/continuous).
