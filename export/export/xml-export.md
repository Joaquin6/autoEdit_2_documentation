## XML \(optional\)

Module: XML FCP7 standard, compatible with Adobe Premiere. Compatible with Avid? Advantage is can add multi track.

See srt to XML FCP7 module for more on building those kind of XMLs [https://www.npmjs.com/package/srt2xmeml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/srt2xmeml) [https://github.com/woutervroege/node-srt2xmeml](https://github.com/woutervroege/node-srt2xmeml)

Which converts srt file into text tracks in XML FCP7 specs.

XML FCP7 specs [https://documentation.apple.com/en/finalcutpro/usermanual/index.html\#chapter=97%26section=3%26tasks=true](https://documentation.apple.com/en/finalcutpro/usermanual/index.html#chapter=97%26section=3%26tasks=true)

Maybe make library that composes “EDL json” into XML FCP7.

Where “EDL JSON” refers to datastructrue of paper-edit in autoEdit 3, representing a video sequence.

> Getting back to the “exporting from Final Cut, Premiere etc.” task @cubicgarden @cnorthwood @pietro - just stumbled upon bodymovin, an open source, actively developed After Effects plugin for exporting AE animations to open web formats: [https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) . Maybe interesting? Didn’t try it yet, but if it does what it promises to do, it could be a helpful part of the workflow..
