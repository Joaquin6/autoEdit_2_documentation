<!-- find QA list made for VOX + add paperedit to it.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dLtZ2OCQRmNnFR5dS-Z8ANK5A4xVrELzEEMn6-k4GbM/edit# -->

Here is a video demo of the  main "Transcription" in v `1.0.5` use case: https://youtu.be/4z143-nJlzs. Needs to be updated with v`1.0.6`  paper-editing. But still relevant for transcription part.

The app should be downloaded on a mac OS X that does not have any [dependencies installed on the system, e.g. node, ffmpeg, etc](/dependencies.md). Here is the [latest release](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/releases).     

For any issues during the QA process please file in[Github repo](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2) and assign to `pietrop`, tag them as `QA` and the version number eg `1.0.6`.
